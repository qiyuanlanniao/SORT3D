Human: End of examples. Now please solve the following task FRESH based on the current object list.

Reasoning: 
The user has instructed the robot to "go to the chair." However, there are multiple chairs in the environment (21 chairs, to be exact). I need to determine which chair the user is referring to.

I will use the `find_near` tool to find the chair closest to the robot (anchor_id: -1).
Code:
