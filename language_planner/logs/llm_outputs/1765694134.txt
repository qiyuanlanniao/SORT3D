Human: End of examples. Now please solve the following task FRESH based on the current object list.

Object...
Reasoning: 
The user has instructed the robot to "go to the chair." However, there are 57 chairs in the object list, so I need to determine which chair the user is referring to. 

Since the instruction is ambiguous, I need to make a reasonable assumption about which chair the user might mean. Common interpretations could include:
1. The chair closest to the robot's current position.
2. The chair that is most centrally located or prominent in the room.
3. The chair that is most likely to be the user's intended target based on typical navigation commands.

Given that the robot starts at (144, 79, 0), the most logical interpretation is to navigate to the chair closest to the robot's current position. This is a common default behavior for such commands.

I will use the `find_near` tool to find the chair closest to the robot (anchor_id = -1).
Code:
def go():
