Human: End of examples. Now please solve the following task FRESH based on the current object list.

Object...
Reasoning: 
The user has instructed the robot to "go to the chair." However, there are 67 chairs in the object list, so I need to determine which chair the user is referring to. 

Since the instruction is ambiguous, I need to make a reasonable assumption about which chair the user might mean. Here are some possible approaches:

1. **Closest Chair to the Robot**: The robot starts at (184, 88, 0). I can find the chair closest to the robot's starting position using the `find_near` tool with the robot's ID (-1) as the anchor.

2. **Chair in a Specific Location**: If there were any contextual clues (e.g., "the chair near the corner" or "the chair in the middle"), I could use tools like `find_objects_near_room_corner` or `order_left_to_right` to identify the chair. However, the instruction is generic.

3. **Default to the First Chair**: This is not ideal, as it might not align with the user's intent.

The most reasonable approach is to assume the user wants the robot to go to the chair closest to its current position. I will use the `find_near` tool to find the chair closest to the robot.
