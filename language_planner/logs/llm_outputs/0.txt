Reasoning: 
The user instruction is to "go to the table." There are four tables in the scene:

- Table(ID:22) in room_0
- Table(ID:23) in room_0
- Table(ID:31) in room_0
- Table(ID:45) in room_1

The robot's current position is at (15, 98, 0), which is closer to room_0 based on the grid dimensions (71, 174). Since no specific table is mentioned, I should navigate to the table closest to the robot's current position.

To determine the closest table, I can use the `find_near` tool with the robot's ID (-1) as the anchor.
The tables are ordered from closest to furthest as follows:
- Table(ID:22) (index 0)
- Table(ID:23) (index 1)
- Table(ID:31) (index 2)
- Table(ID:45) (index 3)

Since the user did not specify which table, I will navigate to the closest one, which is Table(ID:22).
Code:
def go():
    go_near(22)
