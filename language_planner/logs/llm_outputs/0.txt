User Input: 
go to the chair
Reasoning: 
The user has instructed the robot to "go to the chair." However, there are multiple chairs in the environment, so I need to determine which chair the user is referring to. 

Since the instruction is ambiguous, I should consider the chair that is closest to the robot's current position. The robot's current position is given by the object with ID -1 (egorobot).

I will use the `find_near` tool to find the chair closest to the robot.
The closest chair to the robot is the chair with ID 0. I will now command the robot to go near this chair.
Code:
def go():
    go_near(0)
