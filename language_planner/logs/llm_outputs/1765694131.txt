Human: End of examples. Now please solve the following task FRESH based on the current object list.

Object...
Reasoning: 
The user has instructed the robot to "go to the chair." However, there are 54 chairs in the object list, so I need to determine which chair the user is referring to. 

Since the instruction is ambiguous, I need to make a reasonable assumption about which chair to navigate to. Here are some possible approaches:

1. **Closest Chair to the Robot**: The robot starts at (183, 116, 0). I can find the chair closest to the robot's current position using the `find_near` tool with the robot's ID (-1) as the anchor.

2. **Most Central Chair**: I could find the chair that is most centrally located in the room, but this might not be straightforward without additional tools.

3. **Chair in a Specific Position**: I could use tools like `order_left_to_right` or `order_bottom_to_top` to find the leftmost, rightmost, or most prominent chair, but this might not align with the user's intent.

The most reasonable assumption is that the user wants the robot to go to the chair closest to its current position. I will use the `find_near` tool to find the chair closest to the robot.
