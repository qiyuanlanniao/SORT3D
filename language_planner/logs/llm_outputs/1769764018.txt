Human: End of examples. Now please solve the following task FRESH based on the current object list.

Object...
Reasoning: 
The user has instructed the robot to "Go to the chair next to the nearest table."

First, I need to identify the nearest table to the robot's current position. The robot's current position is given by the object with ID -1 (egorobot) at coordinates (180, 121, 0).

Next, I need to find the table that is closest to the robot. There are four tables in the object list with IDs 36, 37, 38, and 39, and 40.

After identifying the nearest table, I need to find the chair that is next to it. "Next to" could mean either to the left or right of the table, or generally near it. I will use the `find_near` tool to find the chair closest to the nearest table.
The nearest table to the robot is table 38. Now, I need to find the chair that is next to this table. I will use the `find_near` tool again to find the chair closest to table 38.
The closest chair to table 38 is chair 28. Therefore, the chair next to the nearest table is chair 28.

Now, I will command the robot to go near chair 28.
Code:
def go():
    go_near(28)
