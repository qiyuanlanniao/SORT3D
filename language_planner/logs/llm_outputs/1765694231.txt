Human: End of examples. Now please solve the following task FRESH based on the current object list.

Object...
Reasoning: 
The user has instructed the robot to "go to the chair." However, there are 72 chairs in the object list, so I need to determine which chair the user is referring to. 

Since the instruction is ambiguous, I need to make a reasonable assumption about which chair the user might mean. Here are some possible approaches:

1. **Closest Chair to the Robot**: The robot starts at (19, 110, 0). I can find the chair closest to the robot's starting position using the `find_near` tool with the robot's ID (-1) as the anchor.

2. **Chair in a Specific Location**: If the chairs are arranged in a particular pattern (e.g., around a table or in a row), I could use tools like `order_left_to_right` or `find_between` to identify a specific chair. However, the user hasn't provided any specific details about the chair's location or arrangement.

3. **Most Central or Prominent Chair**: If there is a chair that stands out due to its size or position, I could use the `order_smallest_to_largest` tool to find the largest chair or the `find_objects_near_room_corner` tool to find a chair in a corner. However, this seems less likely to be the user's intent.

Given the ambiguity, the most reasonable assumption is that the user wants the robot to go to the chair closest to its starting position. I will use the `find_near` tool to find the chair closest to the robot.
The `find_near` tool has returned the list of chairs ordered by their distance from the robot's starting position. The closest chair to the robot is chair with ID 8.

Since the user's instruction was to "go to the chair," and no specific chair was mentioned, it is most reasonable to assume they meant the closest chair to the robot. Therefore, I will command the robot to go near chair 8.
The robot has successfully executed the command to go near chair 8. I will now confirm completion.
Code:
def go():
    go_near(8)
