Human: End of examples. Now please solve the following task FRESH based on the current object list.

Object...
Reasoning: 
The user has asked to "go to the chair." However, there are 44 chairs in the object list, so I need to determine which chair the user is referring to. 

Since the instruction is ambiguous, I need to make a reasonable assumption about which chair to navigate to. Here are some possible approaches:

1. **Closest Chair to the Robot**: The robot starts at (151, 111, 0). I can use the `find_near` tool to find the chair closest to the robot (anchor_id = -1, which represents the robot).

2. **Chair in a Specific Location**: If there were any contextual clues (e.g., "the chair near the corner" or "the chair in the middle"), I could use tools like `find_objects_near_room_corner` or `order_left_to_right` to identify the chair. However, the instruction is generic.

3. **Default to the First Chair**: This is not ideal, as it may not align with the user's intent.

The most reasonable approach is to navigate to the chair closest to the robot's starting position. I will use the `find_near` tool to find the chair closest to the robot.
