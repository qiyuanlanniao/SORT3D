Reasoning: 
The user has instructed the robot to "go to the chair." However, there are multiple chairs in the environment, so I need to determine which chair the user is referring to. 

Since the instruction is ambiguous, I should consider the chair that is closest to the robot's current position. The robot's current position is given by the object with ID -1 (egorobot).

I will use the `find_near` tool to find the chair closest to the robot.
The chair closest to the robot is chair 36. Since the instruction is ambiguous, I will assume the user wants the robot to go to the closest chair. 

I will now command the robot to go near chair 36.
