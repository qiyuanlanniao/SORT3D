Reasoning: 
The user has instructed the robot to "go to the chair." However, there are multiple chairs in the environment (7 chairs in total). I need to determine which chair the user is referring to. 

Since the instruction is ambiguous, I need to make a reasonable assumption. Common strategies in such cases include:
1. Going to the chair closest to the robot's starting position.
2. Going to the chair that is most centrally located or most prominent (e.g., largest or most isolated).
3. Going to the chair that is closest to another prominent object (if any were provided).

In this case, there are no other objects or context provided, so the most reasonable assumption is to go to the chair closest to the robot's starting position (101, 112, 0).

I will calculate the distance from the robot's starting position to each chair and select the closest one.
Code:
def go():
