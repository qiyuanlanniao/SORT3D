Object List: 
[[0, 'cha...
Reasoning: 
The user has instructed the robot to "go to the chair." However, there are 38 chairs in the object list, so I need to determine which chair the user is referring to. 

Since the instruction is ambiguous, I need to make a reasonable assumption about which chair the user might mean. Here are some possible approaches:

1. **Closest Chair**: The user might mean the chair closest to the robot's current position. This is a common interpretation when the instruction is ambiguous.
2. **Most Central Chair**: The user might mean the chair that is most centrally located in the room or among the group of chairs.
3. **Leftmost/Rightmost Chair**: The user might mean the leftmost or rightmost chair in the room.

Given that the robot's current position is (284, 119, 0), the most logical interpretation is to navigate to the chair closest to the robot. I will use the `find_near` tool to find the chair closest to the robot (anchor_id = -1).
