Human: End of examples. Now please solve the following task FRESH based on the current object list.

Object...
Reasoning: 
The user has instructed the robot to "go to the chair." However, there are 68 chairs in the object list, so I need to determine which chair the user is referring to. 

Since the instruction is ambiguous, I need to make a reasonable assumption about which chair the user wants the robot to navigate to. Here are some possible approaches:

1. **Closest Chair to the Robot**: The robot's current position is at (283, 99, 0). The most logical assumption is that the user wants the robot to go to the chair closest to its current position.

2. **Chair in a Specific Location**: If the user had specified a location (e.g., "the chair near the corner" or "the chair in the middle"), I could use tools like `find_objects_near_room_corner` or `order_left_to_right` to identify the correct chair. However, no such context is provided.

3. **Default to the First Chair**: This is not ideal, as the first chair in the list may not be the most relevant.

Given the lack of additional context, the best approach is to assume the user wants the robot to navigate to the chair closest to its current position. I will use the `find_near` tool to find the chair closest to the robot (anchor_id = -1).
