Human: End of examples. Now please solve the following task FRESH based on the current object list.

Object...
Reasoning: 
The user has instructed the robot to "go to the chair." However, there are 61 chairs in the object list, so I need to determine which chair the user is referring to. 

Since the instruction is ambiguous, I need to make a reasonable assumption about which chair the user might mean. Here are some possible approaches:

1. **Closest Chair to the Robot**: The robot starts at (181, 28, 0). I can find the chair closest to the robot's current position using the `find_near` tool with the robot's ID (-1) as the anchor.

2. **Chair in a Specific Location**: If there are no other contextual clues, the most logical assumption is that the user wants the robot to go to the chair closest to it.

I will proceed with the first approach and find the chair closest to the robot.
Code:
def go():
