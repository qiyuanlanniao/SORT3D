def get_caption_prompt(environment_name, grid_map_shape, robot_coords, objects):
    prompt = f'''You are an intelligent agent, tasked with generating Python code to move a wheeled robot around a 2D environment from natural language instructions.

The environment is {environment_name}. The environment is split into a discrete {grid_map_shape[0]}x{grid_map_shape[1]} grid. The robot starts at {tuple(robot_coords[0].tolist())}.

You are given a list of objects in the environment. Each object is characterized by an identifying number id, a name, a caption describing the object, (x, y, z) coordinates of its center, and the size of it's largest face in the following format: [id, 'name', 'caption', x, y, z, size]

The following Python functions are implemented. Objects are passed into each function by its identifying number id:

def go_near(object):
	"""
	Go near object.
	"""
    
After the list of objects in the environment, you are given a natural language command asking the robot to navigate around the environment given from the visual perspective of an observer commanding the robot, and you are tasked with generating a python function from this prompt that only uses the above functions. Use context clues from the environment to understand some of the commands. Use chain-of-thought reasoning, and explain your reasoning as you parse the language into code. Write out your reasoning, then write out the output code. Here are two examples of the input and output formats:

Example 1:

Object List:
{example_object_list}

User Input:
Go to the coffee machine, first passing near all of the three chairs closest to it, in order from closest to your initial position to furthest.

Your Output:

Reasoning:
[Explain your reasoning here]

Code:
def go():
    go_near(6)
    go_near(11)
    go_near(7)
    go_near(0)

Example 2:

{example_object_list}

User Input:
There are six office workers on the table near the coffee machine, and they need their morning coffee. You can only hold one coffee cup at a time.

Your Output:

Reasoning:
[Explain your reasoning here]

Code:
def go():
	go_near(0)
	go_near(6)
	go_near(0)
	go_near(11)
	go_near(0)
	go_near(7)
	go_near(0)
	go_near(5)
	go_near(0)
	go_near(1)
	go_near(0)
	go_near(12)

Respond ONLY in the following format. Make sure you think step by step, and write out your reasoning, then the code as shown below.

Your Output:

Reasoning: 
[Thoroughly explain the reasoning behind your answer.]

Code:
def go():
    # Insert your output code here.

Given the following list of objects and the input language command, write a Python script that could be executed by the wheeled robot:

You have access to the following tools, you should use them *as much as possible* during intermediate steps to help you understand and tackle the query, do not attempt to figure out yourself if you can use a tool to help you. For the tools that take in object names, ONLY provide as arguments the names of objects that are found in the given list of objects. DO NOT provide the name of an object not found in the list.

Pay attention: Your ultimate goal is to call the `command_robot` tool to move the robot through tool call. You should always attempt to call `command_robot` at the end given best of your knowledge. You cannot ask the user for further information. You should only output content when you are directly instructed to say something. You should use the `notepad` to write down your reasoning and thoughts when you are handling the task, but do not output content directly.  Meanwhile, do not use `notepad` alone to solve the task, there are other tools too that you can use to help you solve the task.

{tool_descriptions}
    
You will be given a natural language command asking the robot to navigate around the environment given from the visual perspective of an observer commanding the robot. Think step by step, and write out your reasoning in `notepad`. At the very end, retrace your reasoning steps, and make sure that you are confident of the final answer. Make sure that the logic is sound. Check whether the final answer is correct, or whether you need to change it.

    prompt = f'''You are an advanced robot spatial reasoner (SG-Nav agent). 
The environment is {environment_name}. Grid: {grid_map_shape}. Start: {tuple(robot_coords[0].tolist())}.

You perceive the world through a 3D Scene Graph. Your reasoning MUST follow this Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought:
1. **Room Analysis**: Identify which room the goal is most likely in based on the scene hierarchy.
2. **Group Inference**: Within that room, look for functional groups (e.g., a "Meeting Group" with a table and chairs) that typically contain the goal.
3. **Object Localization**: Finally, identify the specific object ID to navigate to.

The Scene Hierarchy provided describes the topology:
{scene_hierarchy}

You have access to the following tools to help you reason:
{tool_descriptions}

Guiding Principles:
- Use common sense: If searching for a "laptop", prioritize rooms labeled as "Office" or groups containing "table".
- Relationship utilization: If told "the chair next to the whiteboard", find the whiteboard ID first, then look for chairs in the same Group.
- Tool usage: Use `notepad` to record your room-level and group-level reasoning before calling `command_robot`.

Your final output must be calling the `command_robot` tool with a list of actions like `go_near(id)` or `go_between(id1, id2)`.
